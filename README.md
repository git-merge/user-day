# Git Merge - User Day

Friday, May 10th is the **User Day** of Git Merge Berlin. 

The day will be a mix of lightning talks and un-conference style impromptu group talks. This repository will be used to track topics and archive discussions.

## Create an Issue

If you want to discuss something, **start an issue in this repository** so that other people who are interested can find out who is interested in what and can either address the topic in a lightning talk or create a small group to discuss it.  These topics will help facilitate the hack day work as well.

## User Day Notes

In the docs/ subdirectory of this repository we would like to document what was discussed and any decisions that were made or actions that should be taken.  If you see something or can help us document the discussions that this day results in, please send a pull request to imrpove it.
